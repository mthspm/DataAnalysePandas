# DataAnalysePandas

## 1. Introduction

Hi everyone! This is a repository that is dedicated to my studies on data analysis with Pandas.
I will be using the Jupyter Notebook to write my codes and explanations, once I think it is a good tool to process the analysis cause saves the reading data on memory and allows the visualization of the data in a more interactive way.

## 2. What is Pandas?

Pandas is a library of Python that is used to manipulate and analyze data. It is a powerful tool to work with data, once it provides data structures and functions that allow the user to work with data in a more efficient way.
